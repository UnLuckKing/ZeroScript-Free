# Changelog

All notable changes to ZeroScript Free are documented here.

## [1.3.9] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Bridge: kill the full process tree on restart instead of just the wrapper
  process, which used to leave orphaned StudioMCP.exe instances behind that
  fought the next launch and caused seemingly random "Studio looks connected
  but nothing responds" failures.
- Bridge: a dead MCP server is now auto-restarted by a background watchdog
  instead of waiting for the next tool call to notice.
- Bridge: a tool call that hits one of Studio's own brief connection blips now
  retries once instead of surfacing a spurious "Studio not connected" error.
- Extension: the status bar no longer shows a falsely healthy "N tools" label
  when the agent is active but Studio, the place, or the bridge itself isn't
  actually usable, it now names the real blocker (open a place / enable the
  MCP server / bridge offline).
- Cross-provider: DeepSeek, Gemini, Kimi, GLM and Qwen composer menus, model
  pickers and tooltips (including GLM's search hover card and Kimi's model
  popover) no longer render clipped or hidden behind ZeroScript's own
  bar/pill/cover.
- Cross-provider: a thinking model quoting command JSON in its own reasoning
  area no longer makes the tool chip flap between done/run/done (Gemini, Kimi,
  GLM and Qwen).
- The "Agent is working" composer cover now blocks clicks into the composer
  underneath it instead of letting them through, and can no longer balloon
  past the composer's visible band or drag itself off position when a site
  recreates its editor node mid-session (seen on Kimi).
- A command chip could briefly flash or restart its spinner when revisiting a
  past turn; it now settles to done correctly instead.
- DeepSeek: the raw system-prompt turn no longer flashes for a frame before
  being hidden.
- Gemini: "New chat" no longer gets stuck on "Agent active" from a reused
  previous conversation URL.
- Kimi: reasoning is read separately from the actual reply, so a command
  drafted while the model is still "thinking" is no longer detected or
  executed; input can no longer be typed mid-run after the editor node is
  recreated.
- Arena: unsupported-mode gate now also covers Web Search and Generate Image,
  and chip alignment is fixed when a command turn renders as an A/B
  model-comparison carousel.
- Bridge: a long-running tool call no longer starves the connection's ping
  handling and trips the half-open-socket watchdog.

### Changed
- Bridge and installer logs moved to `logs/bridge_debug.log` and
  `logs/start.log`; the console now only shows what a user actually needs to
  read, full detail still lands in the log files.
- `start.bat` now detects and explains a double launch instead of silently
  replacing the previous instance, and warns clearly if port 17613 stays held
  after trying to free it.
- Removed remaining em dashes from user-visible strings.
- Removed remaining em dashes from user-visible strings.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- Bridge no longer depends on Roblox's `mcp.bat`, which hard-coded a single
  Studio version path and broke (0 tools / "Bridge or Studio offline") once
  Studio auto-updated and that version folder was removed. A new
  `launch_studio_mcp.py` finds the newest installed `StudioMCP.exe` and launches
  it directly.
- `bridge.py` now runs a `.py` MCP command with the same Python interpreter as
  the bridge, so it works on installs where only the `py` launcher exists.
